      "Ninigi no Mikoto carries the legacy of the heavens in every measured step, his presence commanding yet serene. Clad in an ensemble of deep reds and pure whites, his attire mirrors the sacredness of his lineage. In his hand is a katana, an heirloom of the gods, its blade whispering tales of battles fought in the silence before the dawn. His eyes, sharp and discerning, miss no detail of the world he has sworn to protect.",

      "Ame no Uzume no Mikoto is the embodiment of life's exuberant dance, her spirit as untamable as the wind. Adorned in vibrant robes that swirl around her in a riot of colors, she captures the joy of the heavens in her every move. Ribbons that twist and twirl in her hands like captured rainbows are her instruments, and with them, she orchestrates the rhythms of revelry and delight that pulse through the divine realms.",
