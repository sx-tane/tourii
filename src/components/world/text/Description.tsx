      Embark on a journey to the Touriiverse, where timeless myths and today's
      Japan converge in a tapestry of fantasy. Explore three enchanted realms:
      the exalted Takagamahara above, the serene Ashihara no Nakatsukuni below,
      and the mysterious Yomitsukuni, where spirits linger. Venture across the
      divine Ame No Ukihashi or tread along the shadowed Yomotsu Hirasaka,
      pathways to worlds unknown. In this land, Amatsukami, Kunitsukami, Bonjin,
      Yomitsukami, and Yokai coexist, weaving stories of old into the fabric of
      the present.
