They find themselves amidst the Komatsu Fire Festival, a local ritual for good harvests and protection against evil spirits, now overshadowed by a severe drought destroying half of Ogata's rice crops. The reason for this calamity is unknown, but the people's strong will has created a divine aura at the falls, drawing Sarutahiko from hiding. He reveals his mission to assist Ninigi in claiming rulership of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni, as instructed by Amaterasu. However, the fading human belief in kami has led to the disappearance of Okuninushi and Kunitsukami and weakened Sarutahiko, who has expended his remaining power for this crucial encounter with Ninigi.",

      "Sarutahiko, concerned about their safety, leads the group to the Ichinomiya Hachiman Shrine. He warns that their divine aura might attract malevolent corrupted Kunitsukami or Yokai, who might regain power from his presence. The shrine, dedicated to the great Hachiman, a kunitsukami protector of farmers, fishermen, and warriors, represents the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism.\r\rSarutahiko reveals that many Kunitsukami have become corrupt, resorting to violence for survival, with only a few still revered and maintaining peace. Bungo Ono, where they've descended, is unique for its harmonious blend of Shintoism and Buddhism, and located away from the main stream cities, is often overlooked by powerful beings.\r\rSuddenly, Sarutahiko collapses, weakened. Ninigi inquires how to restore his strength. Sarutahiko suggests seeking the great Dainichi Nyorai at the Miyazaki East and West Stone Carved Buddha Cliff. Dainichi Nyorai, the chief deity in Shingon Buddhism, symbolizes a life force akin to the sun, similar to Amaterasu. His audience might reveal why Ninigi was sent to 2024 and how he could return, while potentially healing Sarutahiko.\r\rHow do we get there Ninigi would ask. Take my CAR Sarutahiko said. CAR? Ninigi inquire. Ninigi will learn about the various transportation the modern Bonjin uses.",

Shaka Nyorai assured that his other regalia could help locate and restore the mirror's fragments.

With a message from Yakushi Nyorai to herald their journey, they plan to meet this revered kami.

Hana no Moto, known for her insight into the ways of spirits, implores Ninigi to choose a path of compassion, suggesting that an offering of sake might soothe the serpent's woes. She points them towards Inari Okami, a deity with a connection to the Takakiya Sake Brewery, to procure this pacifying elixir.\r\rWith a solution in hand and the harmony of the land at stake, Ninigi's party must also consider the healing and relocation of the great serpent. The mantra given by Yakushi Nyorai could hold the key to easing Oodamaki's suffering, while the strength required to move him could only come from a powerful kami like Takemikazuchi no Kami. Hana no Moto advises learning the sacred Kagura dance to summon this deity, guiding them to the Kagura Hall and subsequently to the Kashimagu Shrine, setting the stage for a dance that would intertwine their fates with the divine and the serpentine.",
