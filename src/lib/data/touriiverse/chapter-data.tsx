		"A long time ago, the world was born from chaos. The gods created three realms: ***Takamagahara***, the bright heavens where the gods live; ***Ashihara no Nakatsukuni***, the lively world of humans; and ***Yomi***, the dark and silent land of the dead. For many years, the realms were in balance, but now, trouble is beginning to grow.\r\rIn the shining heavens of ***Takamagahara***, the Sun Goddess ***Amaterasu*** gives her grandson, ***Ninigi***, an important mission. She tells him to go to the human world to bring back peace and balance. With special treasures to guide him, Ninigi steps onto the ***Ame-no-ukihashi***, a bridge that connects the heavens to the earth.\r\rSuddenly, a storm begins. Thunder roars, lightning flashes, and the bridge shakes. The storm becomes so strong that the bridge collapses, and Ninigi falls into a swirling cloud of chaos.\r\rWhen he wakes up, he is lying beside a beautiful waterfall surrounded by mist. In the distance, he sees a shadowy figure watching him. Ninigi knows that his journey is just beginning.",
