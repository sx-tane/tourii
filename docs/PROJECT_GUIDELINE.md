# üìù Tourii Project Guideline

This document serves as a living guideline to track the development status and priorities of the Tourii platform.

## üéØ Vision & Design Philosophy

Tourii embraces modern minimalism infused with traditional Japanese aesthetics, creating an adventurous yet elegant experience. The interface prioritizes:

- Clean layouts with ample white space (ma - Èñì)
- Subtle Japanese-inspired elements (wave patterns, stamp motifs, calligraphic touches)
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
- Delightful micro-interactions that enhance without overwhelming
- A tone that balances adventure with sophistication

### Core Design Principles
1. **Minimalism with Purpose**: Every element should serve a clear function while maintaining visual harmony
2. **Cultural Integration**: Japanese design elements should be subtle and meaningful, not decorative
3. **User-Centric Flow**: Navigation should feel natural and guide users through their journey
4. **Responsive Feedback**: Micro-interactions should provide satisfying feedback without distraction
5. **Content First**: Visual design should enhance content without competing with it
