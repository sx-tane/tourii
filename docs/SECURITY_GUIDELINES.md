# ðŸ”’ Tourii Security Guidelines

## Overview

## 1. Rate Limiting

### Why It's Important

Uncontrolled endpoint access can lead to:

- Database crashes
- Excessive Supabase usage
- Increased costs
- Vulnerability to DDoS attacks

### Implementation Tools

- Supabase Edge Functions with rate limiter
- Vercel Middleware
- Next.js middleware for IP throttling

### Action Items

- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- [ ] Set appropriate limits based on endpoint usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor and adjust limits as needed

## 2. Row-Level Security (RLS)

### Why It's Important

Without RLS, users can potentially access other users' data.

### Implementation Steps

1. Enable RLS on all tables:
   - Navigate to Table â†’ RLS â†’ Enable
   - Implement policies using `user_id = auth.uid()`
2. Test policies thoroughly
3. Never disable RLS in production

### Action Items

- [ ] Enable RLS on all tables from day one
- [ ] Create appropriate policies for each table
- [ ] Document all RLS policies
- [ ] Regular security audits of RLS policies

## 3. CAPTCHA Implementation

### Why It's Important

Prevents automated bot attacks and fake signups.

### Required Locations

- Signup forms
- Login pages
- Password reset flows

### Implementation Options

- hCaptcha
- reCAPTCHA

### Action Items

- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA on all authentication flows
- [ ] Regular testing of CAPTCHA effectiveness
- [ ] Monitor failed CAPTCHA attempts

## 4. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Implementation Steps for Vercel

1. Navigate to Vercel â†’ Settings â†’ Security â†’ Web Application Firewall
2. Enable "Attack Challenge" on all routes

### Benefits

- Blocks malicious traffic before reaching the application
- No code changes required
- Built-in DDoS protection

### Action Items

- [ ] Enable WAF in all environments
- [ ] Monitor WAF logs regularly
- [ ] Configure custom rules as needed

## 5. API Keys and Secrets Management

### Best Practices

- Store all secrets in .env files
- Use server-only functions for sensitive operations
- Never expose secrets in frontend code
- Regular rotation of API keys

### Action Items

- [ ] Audit codebase for exposed secrets
- [ ] Implement secret rotation schedule
- [ ] Document all API keys and their purposes
- [ ] Review AI-generated code for security compliance

## 6. Backend Input Validation

### Required Validation Points

- Email addresses
- Passwords
- File uploads
- Form inputs
- API payloads

### Implementation Guidelines

- Validate all inputs server-side regardless of frontend validation
- Implement strong type checking
- Sanitize all user inputs

### Action Items

- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Regular testing of validation effectiveness
- [ ] Document validation rules

## 7. Dependencies Management

### Regular Maintenance

- Run `npm audit fix` or `yarn audit` regularly
- Remove unused packages
- Check for critical vulnerabilities
- Minimize dependency usage

### Action Items

- [ ] Schedule regular dependency audits
- [ ] Document essential dependencies
- [ ] Create dependency update procedure
- [ ] Monitor security advisories

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

### Implementation Tools

- Supabase Logs
- Vercel Analytics
- Server-side logging

### What to Monitor

- Failed login attempts
- Traffic spikes
- 500 errors
- Unhandled exceptions
- API usage patterns

### Logging Requirements

- Include timestamps
- Log IP addresses
- Track user sessions
- Monitor authentication events

### Action Items

- [ ] Set up comprehensive logging
- [ ] Implement monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create incident response procedure
- [ ] Regular log analysis

## Regular Security Reviews

Schedule regular security reviews to:

1. Audit all security measures
2. Update policies as needed
3. Review logs and incidents
4. Update security documentation

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Email security@tourii.com immediately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for confirmation before any disclosure
